This app was created using 4 popular React libraries : Axios, Cheerio, DotEnv and Twilio. 

This is a webscraper app used to notify you by text as soon as Bitcoin reaches a certain value. 
I used:
 1. Axios to fetch the data from the webiste
 2. Cheerio to parse the data into HTML.
 3. DotEnv to hide my authentication information
 4. Twilio to send a text message as soon as the condition is met. 


 This app can be customized by changing the name of the tracking item or we can add more items to track.
